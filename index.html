    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I'm a Carleton University Student in my final year. I decided to put my projects together 
        in one space where I can easily access and show everyone. I've included some fun school
        assignments as well since they all contribute to my experience with programming.
        CHANGE THIS WITH SOMETHING INTRIGUING</p>
